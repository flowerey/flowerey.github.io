Hello! I'm flower, you can call me ash. I make torrenting stuff of every kind (remux, encode, music, games and more). My group is named flower.

I'm interested in speedrunning nowadays. Back then, I was used to speedrun Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2. Even making a speedrunning guide for it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-rjmNffam_09q2NbAKQxdlL7NIqY6vjgqrNaMs0tqY/edit?usp=sharing

You can find me on IRC servers of various trackers. My username is mostly blueberry, blu3berry, vanquished or flowerey.
