Hello, I'm flower!

I'm a pretty lazy person by nature, but somehow I still end up doing a ton of torrent-related stuff.
I’ve been in the scene for almost two years, mostly because it started as a hobby — and never stopped being one.

I make all kinds of releases: remuxes, games, and the occasional random projects when I feel like it.
I also have two groups:

- flower — general releases (remuxes, encodes, music, etc.)
- HAIKU — focused on game releases

Outside of torrenting, I usually spend my time playing games, listening to music, or maintaining stuff on trackers — not because it's fun, but lets call it a Hobby. ;)

What I Work On:
- Mostly remuxes
- Game releases under HAIKU
- Occasional random uploads

Just don’t expect consistent releases. Not because I don't like doing this, but I'm lazy.

I’ve also been a moderator and admin in a ton of places, so I can say I'm experienced.
